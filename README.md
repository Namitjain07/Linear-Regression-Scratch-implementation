# Linear-Regression-Scratch-implementation


This project is a Jupyter Notebook that performs specific tasks using Python. Below is an easy-to-follow description of its structure and functionality:

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary libraries (listed in the notebook):
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - numpy
  - Any other required libraries should be installed before running the code.

## How to Use This Notebook
1. **Open the Notebook:** Launch the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. **Run the Cells:** Execute each cell sequentially to reproduce the results.
3. **Understand the Outputs:** Comments and markdown cells provide explanations for each step.

## Notebook Structure

1. **Introduction**
   - The notebook begins with an introduction, explaining the purpose of the project and providing background information.

2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Loads datasets (CSV files or other formats) and preprocesses the data.
   - Handles missing values, data cleaning, and initial transformations.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizes the data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Identifies trends, patterns, or anomalies in the dataset.

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Constructs new features or modifies existing ones to improve model performance.
   - Normalization, scaling, and encoding steps are included here.

5. **Model Building and Training**
   - Implements machine learning models using Scikit-learn or other libraries.
   - Splits the data into training and testing sets.
   - Trains models and evaluates performance metrics.

6. **Results and Visualization**
   - Presents the results of the analysis and model predictions.
   - Includes graphs, tables, or any other form of result representation.

7. **Conclusion**
   - Summarizes key findings and discusses potential improvements or next steps.

## Customization
- Modify input files or parameters in the code cells to adapt the notebook to different datasets or requirements.

## Running Instructions
